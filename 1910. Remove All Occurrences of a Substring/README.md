# 🎯 Problem Statement

We need to **remove all occurrences** of a substring `part` from a given string `s` until none are left.

Example:
`s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, `part = "abc"`
👉 Remove `"abc"` → `"dabaabcbc"`
👉 Remove `"abc"` → `"dabcbc"`
👉 Remove `"abc"` → `"dc"`
✅ Final Answer = `"dc"`

# 🧠 Intuition

Think of `s` as a **long text ribbon 🎀**, and `part` as a **sticker 🎟️** that keeps appearing on it.

Our job is to keep **peeling off** all those stickers until the ribbon has no stickers left! 🧽✨

---

# 🛠️ Approach (Step by Step)

1. **Find occurrence** 🔍
   Use `s.find(part)` to check if `part` exists inside `s`.

2. **Erase it** ✂️
   If found, remove it using `s.erase(position, part.length())`.

3. **Repeat** 🔄
   Keep repeating until no more `part` is found.

4. **Return result** 🎁
   Whatever is left in `s` is our final cleaned string.

# ⚡ Code Walkthrough with Example

```cpp
while(s.length()!=0 && s.find(part) < s.length()) {
    s.erase(s.find(part), part.length());
}
```

### Example Run:

* `s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, `part = "abc"`
* Step 1: `find("abc")` → index `2` → erase `"abc"` → `"dabaabcbc"`
* Step 2: `find("abc")` → index `4` → erase `"abc"` → `"dabcbc"`
* Step 3: `find("abc")` → index `2` → erase `"abc"` → `"dc"`
* Step 4: No `"abc"` left → stop.

✅ Output = `"dc"`

# 📊 Complexity Analysis

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

* Each `find` = **O(n)** (worst case, scanning string).
* Each `erase` = **O(n)** (shifting characters).
* If we remove `k` occurrences, total complexity = **O(k·n)**.

👉 Worst case = **O(n²)** (if part is small and occurs many times).

### 🗂️ Space Complexity

* We modify `s` **in place**, so extra space = **O(1)**.

# 🎨 Visual Representation

```
Initial:   daabcbaabcbc
Remove 1:  da[abc]baabcbc -> dabaabcbc
Remove 2:  daba[abc]bc    -> dabcbc
Remove 3:  d[abc]c        -> dc
Final:     dc
```

🔍 = find
✂️ = erase
🔄 = repeat

---

# 🌟 Key Takeaways

* Very **straightforward approach** → `find + erase`.
* **Simple & clean** but not optimal for huge strings.
* Could be improved with a **stack-based approach** (linear time).

---

⚡ So, the given solution is 👍 for small/medium input sizes.
But for **very large strings**, you’d want to optimize with **stack-based simulation** or **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)** algorithm 🚀.
